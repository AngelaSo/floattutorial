Practicing usage of floats

Challenge 1: Simple Float
Create an orange square in code using the 'figure' tag. Follow that by a 'p' with > 100 words of filler text.
(Orange square should be 150px)
Float the square to the right, give it a 1px black border, and give it 10px margin on any side that would encounter text.
Surround your 'figure' and 'p' with a .container div which is 960px fixed and centered in the page.

Challenge 2: Simple Float with Caption
Using the <figure> element again, this time with an <img> tag inside and following the html5 spec. Take the same setup we had before...and add a caption below the orange box, the figure should have 10px padding and its outside margins should now be 15px
There should be 10px space between the caption and the image as well
