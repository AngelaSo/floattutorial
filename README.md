Practicing usage of floats

Challenge 1: Simple Float Create an orange square in code using the 'figure' tag. Follow that by a 'p' with > 100 words of filler text. (Orange square should be 150px) Float the square to the right, give it a 1px black border, and give it 10px margin on any side that would encounter text. Surround your 'figure' and 'p' with a .container div which is 960px fixed and centered in the page.

Challenge 2: Simple Float with Caption Using the 'figure' element again, this time with an 'img' tag inside and following the html5 spec. Take the same setup as in Challenge 1 and add a caption below the orange box The figure should have a 10px padding and its outside margins should now be 15px. There should be a 10px space between the caption and the image as well.
