Practicing usage of floats

Challenge 1: Simple Float
Create an orange square in code using the <figure> tag. Follow that by a <p> with > 100 words of filler text.
(Orange square should be 150px)
Float the square to the right, give it a 1px black border, and give it 10px margin on any side that would encounter text.
Surround your <figure> and <p> with a .container div which is 960px fixed and centered in the page.
